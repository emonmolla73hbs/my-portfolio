                    I know Md.EMON MOLLA since 2020. He is a good brother of mine. Very plain, outspoken and smiling person. In these 2 or 3 years, I have felt that he is very much like me. He has become one of my closest friends of mine. He is very hard-work. I feel free and safe sharing something with him even if it is my things or matters. He is an amazing guy.

                    Me and EMON MOLLA became friends around 2014 when we were in class Eight. Since then till now we are still good friends. He is very naughty, talkative and mostly secretive. He loves to argue with a friend in any matter and at last, he wins with his logical arguments. My and other friends just enjoy his logical arguments.

                    I know Molla from my childhood. We were just Hi & Hello friends. But he had a good friend circle and I joined with them in college. Since then me and Molla are very much good friends. We are the specialist of getting treat from other friends. Both of us convince other friends for giving us treat by praising or insulting them. He tries to do something in right time through right way.

                    Molla is my primary school life friend. Till now we are also good friend. His friend circle and my friend circle is same. We studied same primary school, high school, college. Even now we in same university. That's one of the reason of our friendship. He is very talkative and outspoken. He loves arguing. Mostly he argues with me in any matter. It becomes a war between us when it is about arguing.
